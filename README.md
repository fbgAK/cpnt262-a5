## Search research notes/code journal
It was frustrating trying to deploy on to github I had a very hard time and had to restart this assignment a couple times. I am overall glad with how it turned out the frustration mainly came from how local host was working fine and netlify was an issue. Overall I completed the assignment to the best of my abilities.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
